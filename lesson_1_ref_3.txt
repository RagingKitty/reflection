Manual vs Auto Commit

Pro
Better flow of commit, without worry that auto commit will kick in half-way during coding.
Readability is increased as there is no need to have too many small chunks of small commits.
Sharing is also easier because it will be easier to navigate throught the commits.
Roll-backs/ diffs are easier to read.

Con
Easily forgetting to commit.
When there is an emergency when you have to leave your work right away.
Good for coders that are idle sometimes.
You will never lose a single commit.
