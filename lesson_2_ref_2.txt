vc_reflection 2

In staging area, I could add make different changes to different codes and files then add to this area.
I could then carefully choose which files are under the same umbrella and commit those and only those under 1 commit.
This will allow me to have more control of my code and also have a tidier workspace.
Furthermore, I will be able to follow the one commit per logic rule which makes everything clean and organized.

Minimizing complexity and messy codes and maximizing efficiency and readability it utmost important and that's exactly what staging area is designed for.
Even after a long time away from the project, I would still be able to check on the logs if any bugs were to occur under 1 logic.
Debugging would be also easy as it I could revert changes from a specific brunch under the same logic commit.
